_Guake Tabs Indicator_ is an extension for GNOME Shell 3.8-3.10 which displays terminal tabs on the GNOME top panel.

For the time being, it is most aesthetically appealing with the Date/Clock extension disabled.

## Requires Guake 0.4.5-dev (Git)

This extension depends on certain API methods added to Guake after the last release 0.4.4. You can fork the latest `master` branch from Guake [here](http://github.com/guake/guake/) and need to build the latest copy before using Guake Tabs Indicator.
